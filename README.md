## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started: 

* First, start by cloning the repository with the following command in your terminal: git clone https://github.com/AustinWayneSanders/project1.git 
* The database instance that was used when creating this project may not be avaible by the time of cloning this project, resulting in a null pointer exception. In this case, please follow the instructions regarding setting up the database environment with AWS. 
> Once you have logged into your AWS console root account, click on services in the top right corner. This button is circled in white with the image below. 
![Click Servies](project1_Image1.png)
>
> After clicking services, a new menu will appear with a list of Amazon's services. Click the one that is title "RDS." It is cicled in the image below.
> 
![Click RDS](project1_Image2.png)
>
>Once on the RDS page, there is an option near the bottom the screen that says "Create Database". Click this option to start the process of creating a new instance. 
>
![Click Create Database](project1_Image3.png)
>
>This project is configured to communicate with postgreSQL, so select that database. Make sure to select postreSQL ll.13-R1 as the version number. 
>
![Select PostreSQL](project1_Image4.PNG)
>
>Keep the database instance identifier as database-1, keep the master name as postgres, and create the password to be "password". It is acceptable to change other settings, however the default settings will leave you in the free tier. 
>

>
> Make sure that you enable public access to the database. Without this option enabled, the application will not be able to communicate with your database instance. 
>
![Select Public Access](project1_image6.PNG)
>
> You can find the endpoint and port number for you database when you click the link to your database instance. This information will be used to establish the connection with PGadmin. 
>
![Database Access Endpoint for Database Connection](project1_image7.png)
>
> In PgAdmin, create a new server. Copy and past your Amazon database instance endpoint to the host text box on the connection tab. The default port number should be the port number for postgreSQL. If not, change the port number to 5432. 
>

## Usage

> Here, you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

## Contributors and Tasks

This was individual project. The process consisted of full stack development tasks including: 
* Setting up the development environment which involved creating an AWS postgreSQL database instance with database connections in the application, downloading and installing Javalin, downloading and installing Maven along with configuring necessary dependencies in the POM.xml file: JUnit4, Log4J, and JDBC, Javalin. 
* Setting up project directory files and packages to conform to RESTful framework standards: DAOs, entities, controllers, untils, services. 
* Configuring hibernate to communicate with the Amazon database instance
* Creating entity beans for each database table
* Creating services with database processing methods (CRUD operations)
* Creating controllers to call services and establish endpoints for front-end communication
* Starting a Javalin server with routing
* Creating html pages that corresponds to the end-points, along with styling with CSS and Bootstrap.
